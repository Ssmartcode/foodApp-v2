# I am foodie - Web application to find food recipes.

Search food with the help of an external api - https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/

#### This is a new repository for an updated version of an app that can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ssmartcode/I-am-foodie">HERE</a>

The application was built using HTML, CSS with SASS and javaScript. I got the idea of this application from The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert! course on udemy. **The desing and the whole code is my own work.**
